# Stop Staring at the Fridge!
This is a project that was created as part of a [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) Python course. The console app allows the user to search for recipes using the [Edamam API](https://www.edamam.com/). The user can search for recipes based on one ingredient, and the recipes are filtered to match any dietary requirements. There is also the option to save the recipes to a file for future use.
